# Project 1 - Box Office Analysis
UofA Data Analytics Bootcamp - Data exploration & clean up, followed by analysis

For this group project, we decided to analyze movie box office data. Not all of the data we wanted was easily available online, so we had to do some webscraping in order to collect opening weekend revenue for movies over the past few years. The webscraping was done via Beautiful Soup, which is saved under the file "Beautiful_Soup" and "BeautifulSoup_OpeningData".

After the webscraping and saving the data in CSV files, the files were merged together and the data was cleaned up and re-formatted. The file "Team7" contains the file merging, data clean up, data analysis, and chart creations. The screenshots of the different charts are below.
