# Project 1
UofA Data Analytics Bootcamp - Data exploration & clean up, followed by analysis

For this group project, we decided to analyze movie box office data. Not all of the data we wanted was easily available online, so we had to do some webscraping in order to collect opening weekend revenue for movies over the past few years. 

Web scrape box office movie data and save to CSV files. Combine CSV files into one data frame, format data, and create charts answering various questions about the data.
